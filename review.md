## review

I really think that...

It's one of the best all-in Beginner DevOps course on the platform! Maybe the best!

Pros:

\- Imran is a great instructor as a DevOps mentor with real experience and as a real teacher with excellent methodology. I enjoyed a lot Imran's pace, tone, accent :P and funny non-distracting and non-annoying jokes :D

\- Huge amount of topics, all are about top-notched widely-used technologies.

\- Course has great structure, starting with simple things and concepts and going up to more complex abstractions and technologies.

\- Imran regularly updates course and promises more updates in the future.

\- One thing that I really liked and must mention in review. Imran was always available in QnA section! I mean, he answers questions and helps debugging in less than 24 hours, sometimes less than 6 hours! His aid was really helpful and meaningful! Imran seems to have superpowers! Great thanks for that! Community in QnA is also lively and helpful!

Cons:

\- Imran sometimes is a little bit inaccurate with code (whitespaces, indentation, etc), but it's not a big deal :)

\- As of 2023 course needs updates in some sections, but actually in current state it's more challenging, because if you want to start the app and all the services you sometimes need to debug. Most of the time I really enjoyed debugging opportunity :)

Summary:

I highly recommend this course as a great start for junior DevOps engineers and also for a seasoned System Administrators who want to switch or grow further and deep dive in modern tech. If you really want to proceed with DevOps path professionally keep up practicing, setup a homelab with VM's on computer/notebook/NAS.

I already bought the next advanced level Imran's course "DevOps Projects | 20 Real Time DevOps Projects" and looking forward to get my hands dirty :)

Imran Teli, thanks a lot for what you are doing, best wishes and keep up the good work!
